I'm testing the functionality of my new blog with Doom Emacs. There are a few things I would like to test.


## Tests {#tests}

First is code blocks:

```bash
echo "This is a test for the blog"
```

Second is bullet lists:

-   Test 1
-   Test 2
-   Test 3

Third is numbered lists:

1.  Test 1
2.  Test 2
3.  Test 3
