:END:

Welcome to my new blog! This site is built with:

- [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] - A fast static site generator
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] - Org mode to Hugo exporter for Emacs
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Doom Emacs]] - My preferred development environment

*** Why Hugo?

I previously used Ghost for blogging, but I wanted something that:

1. Integrates with my Org-mode workflow in Emacs
2. Allows writing in plain text (version controlled)
3. Deploys as a static site (fast and secure)
4. Doesn't require a database

Hugo checks all these boxes. Combined with ox-hugo, I can write posts in Org mode
and export them directly to Hugo-compatible Markdown.

*** The Setup

Posts are written in a single =posts.org= file using Org subtrees. Each subtree
becomes a separate blog post when exported. The workflow is:

1. Write post as Org subtree
2. Export with =C-c C-e H H= (or =SPC o B e=)
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Webhook triggers rebuild on server
5. Post is live!

Stay tuned for more posts on Emacs, DevOps, and other technical topics.
